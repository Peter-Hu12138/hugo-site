## Abstractions
Engineers and scientists use abstractions to manage complexity. Before, we relied on working operating systems and software development environment to build useful tools; however, in this course, we are diving deeper into lower level: we are disclosing the digital logic by building gates out of electronic switches - MOFSETs. Then, gates are used to build combinational logic - which all CS students have familarized themselves with after first year through building boolean equations in programming and logical condition in math - and sequential logic - which is introduced through feeding back wires, more on it later!

## Semiconductor
pmos and nmos and use them to build gates

## Combinational circuit and combinational devices
min terms and max terms, K maps, propagation delay

half adders and full adders and adder

## Sequential circuit and sequential devices
from latch to SR FF
from FF to D FF, T FF, JK FF
from FF to counter, from async to sync

## Processor
Memory (SRAM and DRAM) and tristate buffer and MIPS architecture and data paths

control unit and fetch, decode and excute cycle

## Assembly language
MIPS, RISC
R type, I type and J type instructions, their translation - organization - to/ from machine code and correspondance with datapath control signals
stack, functional calling, register saving routines in MIPS
